### Best Practices and Recommendations
For this release, we have also implemented several best practices to ensure security, performance, and maintainability:

- **Security Enhancements**: All images now include the latest security patches. We recommend updating your images regularly to keep your environment secure.
- **Commit to Semantic Versioning**: We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for all releases. Make sure to update your dependencies based on the release versioning.
- **Optimized Deployment Strategy**: We suggest using a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime during image upgrades. For more details, refer to the [deployment guide](https://example.com/deployment-guide).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure logging and monitoring are enabled for all services. This release introduces enhanced logging features for better tracking and debugging.

### Known Issues
- **Issue with slow startup times** in Image 2: Some users have reported slow startup times due to a large initial data load. A fix is scheduled for the next release.
- **Compatibility** with older Kubernetes versions: Users running versions lower than 1.19 may encounter issues with our updated Helm charts. Please upgrade your cluster to the latest supported version.
